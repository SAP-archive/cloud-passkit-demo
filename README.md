cloud-passkit-demo
==================

This sample demonstrates how-to create Appleâ„¢ PassKit passes using [jPasskit](https://github.com/bitzeche/jpasskit).

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/SAP/cloud-passkit-demo`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-passkit-demo/archive/master.zip).

**Note**: Please note that you need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program in order to be able to get the necessary certificates required to properly sign your passes! 

Consequently, the provided sample will not run out-of-the-box. You would need to download/create the required certificate files up front. In order to make the provided test case run you'd need to:

+ create your *Certificates.p12* and store it in the [certs](/src/test/resources/certs) folder
+ create the personalized *wwdr.pem" certificate store it in the [certs](/src/test/resources/certs) folder
+ adjust the values in [pass.properties](/src/test/resources/pass.properties) according to your personal/corporate data


Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, the SAP HANA Cloud - Samples project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
